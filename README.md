Slot Booking Tool

Used to book calendar slots for a meeting.

Steps Involved:
1. All available slots are stored in a google sheet.
2. The tool then identifies the slots available for a particular date and books the slot for the user.
3. At the same time the google calendar is booked for the user.

Multiple users can not book the same slot, the sheet is locked once a user is booking a slot.
